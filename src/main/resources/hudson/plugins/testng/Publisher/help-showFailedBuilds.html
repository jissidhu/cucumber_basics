   <b>Show Failed builds in Trend Graph?</b>
   <p>If checked, the plug-in includes results from failed builds in the trend graph. (Disabled by default) </p>
   <p><b>Note</b>:
       <ul>
           <li>If this is a maven build, it is better to configure the build step with
            <code>-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true</code> option. This results in build with test failures
            being marked as Unstable, thus distinguishing it from build that failed because of non test related issues</li>
           <li>Even when this option is selected, failed builds with no results and aborted builds will not be displayed in graphs</li>
       </ul>
   </p>
